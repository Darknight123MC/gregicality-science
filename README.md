# Gregicality Science

**Gregicality Science** adds many new processing lines, machines, mechanics, and more to **GregTech Community Edition Unofficial** and is one module of Gregicality for GTCEu.


Gregicaliy Science expands gameplay beyond the traditional limit of UV-tier, and extends content across the endgame tiers: UHV, UEV, UIV, UXV, OpV, and MAX voltage.


With GCYS, there are many brand-new circuits to manufacture: such as _Optical_ and _Spintronic_, using lasers, electron spin manipulation, and more for your most advanced machinery.


GCYS also adds new power systems for additional content depth. Currently, a pressure and vacuum system has been implemented for creating advanced materials and running machinery such as the new Burner Reactor multiblock. New systems are yet to come, with axles for rotation, optical cables for lasers, particle acceleration tubes, and much more planned for the future!


GCYS additionally provides new complex chemical processes to automate, such as production for Kapton, Kevlar, Carbon Nanotubes, Fullerenes, and much more for producing the most advanced materials yet.


GCYS additionally adds some utility multiblocks, such as the Hydraulic Fracker. This machine can be used to replenish bedrock fluid veins, so you won't need to move your fluid drills anymore!


GCYS makes some large changes to base GTCEu, such as more complex crystal circuit recipes, but provides configuration for all major changes. This allows you to further customize your GregTech experience, and also add the mod to pre-existing GregTechCEu worlds with little trouble.


Gregicality Science is currently in **alpha development**, expect unfinished content and future changes!
